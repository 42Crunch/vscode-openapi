# What is API Conformance Scan

API Conformance Scan is a dynamic API testing tool designed to ensure that your API implementation aligns with its OpenAPI/Swagger definition.
By comparing the documented API specification with the actual implementation, Scan helps you identify any discrepancies or inconsistencies.

To achieve this, Scan generates a multitude of requests that deviate from the declared OpenAPI file and sends them to your server.
The tool then evaluates each response, providing insights into how well your API implementation matches its documented counterpart.

# Getting Started

## Default configuration

When you run Scan for the first time, it generates a default configuration for your OpenAPI file.
 This initial setup produces a set of "happy path" requests, one for every operation defined in your OpenAPI specification.

The contents of each "happy path" request is available to you in the "Operations" tab of the Scan UI.

These "happy path" requests serve as the foundation for testing, establishing a reliable baseline of expected behavior for each operation.
At the start of a test for each operation Scan expects to successfully execute a "happy path" request before running the rest of the test.

This default configuration is suitable for simple operations; however, more complex operations may require customizations
to ensure effective testing.

## Customizing defaults

### Operations

You can change the default happy path requests by modifying their payloads within the Operations tab.
Additionally, you can configure authentication details and fine-tune the body and parameters
of each operation either directly or utilize variable expressions.

### Scenarios

When your API operation relies on pre-existing resources or requires post-execution cleanup,
Scenarios come into play. This is particularly useful when you need to set up certain conditions
before executing an operation and then tear them down afterwards.

A great example of this is the "update user" operation, which updates a user object.
Before calling this operation, you'd typically want to ensure that the user object exists and after the update, remove it.
Scenarios enable you to achieve this by adding operations to the "Before" block (e.g., creating the user),
using the resulting resource in the happy path of the scenario, and then performing cleanup in the "After" block (e.g., deleting the user).

You can create a Scenario for any operation defined in your OpenAPI in the "Scenarios" tab.

## Trying operations

Before launching your scan, you may want to execute individual Operations or Scenarios to ensure they can be successfully run by the Scan.

To facilitate this process, the Scan UI provides a "Try" feature.

When you click "Try" on an Operation or Scenario, the Scan UI will send relevant requests to the server and allow
 you to inspect the details of the payload sent and the response received.

## Starting the Scan

You can initiate scanning from the "Operations" tab in the Scan UI, where you have two options to do that:
 scan the entire API by clicking the "Scan all operations" button at the bottom of the list,
  or click the "Scan" button at the top of a currently selected operation to test just that one operation.

# User Interface

## Operations

Operations tab shows all operations defined in your OpenAPI file. Details of a request configured in this tab are used as a "happy path" request,
 if not overriden by a Scenario for this request.

You can edit details of a request body and parameters by editing them here.
You can also use variable expressions (such as `{{name}}`) to substitute parameters or parts of
the body with values from a variables.

### Environment

The Environment tab in each Operation allows you to define variables that can be used in variable
expressions in request bodies and parameters.

You can also use variable expression within the VALUE field of environment entries,
creating values that combine other existing variables and constants.

For instance, by defining an environment variable `username` with a value like `user-{{$randomuint}}@company.com`,
you can set its actual value to something like `user-555@company.com`.

### Response processing

The Response Processing feature allows you to extract specific values from an operation's responses and
store them in variables, which can then be used in subsequent operations (particularly useful when multiple operations are part of a Scenario).

To achieve this, you can define response processing statements that specify what information to extract,
 where to find it, and where to store the retrieved data. These statements are organized by response code, so if your operation returns multiple
 possible codes (e.g., 200, 400, 5XX), you can create separate groups for each.

Each response processing statement consists of a name of the variable where the extracted information will be stored, as well as a source,
specifying the location where Scan should look for the desired information, such as request
or response body, headers, cookies, path or query string parameters.

Additionally, if you're extracting a value from a request or response body, you can use
JsonPointer or JsonPath to pinpoint the exact location of the value you're looking for.

### Unset variables

In an Operation, every variable expression must resolve to a value before
the Operation can be executed. However, it is possible to reference variables
that do not have a value set.

Unset variables in an Operation may be useful when you plan to use the same
Operation in multiple Scenarios, each providing a different set of values
for every variable used in the Operation.

However, if an Operation contains an unset variable, you cannot utilize the
'Try' feature to test the Operation without first providing a value for it.

To resolve this issue, Scan UI lists all required variables for the Operation
in "Unset variables" and enables you to provide values for them, allowing you
to use the 'Try' feature.

Please note that test inputs are not saved to the scan configuration.

## Scenarios

Use scenarios to create complex sequences of operations to implement a "happy path" request for any operation
that cannot be tested with a single request defined in the Operations tab.

If you define a scenario for an operation, it will be used to perform a "happy path" request instead of the one defined in the Operations tab.

Additionally, if an operation has a defined scenario, you can still use it as is in other scenarios.


### Happy path scenario

The  "happy path" scenario is the only type of scenario you can currently create in Scan.
In future versions of Scan, we plan to introduce additional scenario types.

This scenario contains operation references that should be performed in order to execute the test.
When creating a new scenario, it will initially contain just one reference to the operation selected during scenario creation.

You can add more operation references to the scenario by clicking the "Pick operation" button.
These references can also be reordered within the scenario using drag-and-drop functionality.

Each operation reference within a scenario has its own distinct response processing configuration and
environment variables, which take precedence over those defined at the operation level.

### Before and after blocks

Before and after blocks are used to define operations that should be executed before and after the happy path scenario,
and serve mainly as setup and cleanup steps.

The "Before" and "After" blocks in Scan allow you to define operations that should be executed before and after your Scenario.
These blocks primarily serve as setup and cleanup steps. These blocks are shared between all scenarios.

### Autorization tests

The Authorization Tests section enables you to apply Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)
and Broken Function Level Authorization (BLFA) tests, as defined in the global Tests section, to your scenario.

## Global blocks

The Global Before and After blocks provide an opportunity to execute setup and cleanup steps at the Scan level.
These blocks are run only once, respectively, before and after the entire scan execution, allowing you to perform
global initialization and cleanup tasks.


## Authentication

Certain operations may require authentication to function properly.
Configure authentication settings in the Scan UI's Authentication section.

### Security schemes

A "Security Scheme" describes the type of authentication required by an operation,
closely following the contents of the relevant OpenAPI's Security Scheme.

These security schemes define the authentication requirements and how they should be sent.
 For example, you can specify using an API key and sending it in a specific HTTP header.

### Credentials

Credentials are primarily related to authorization aspects of your operations.
Although all operations might share the same authentication type, some may have different authorization requirements.

For example, while most operations might be accessible to ordinary users, others might require admin privileges.

To effectively test such APIs, you can create distinct Credentials for "ordinary" and
"admin" users, configuring respective operations to use one or the other.

### Secrets

You may need to use secrets like passwords or API keys as credential values.

The best practice is to avoid storing these sensitive values directly in your scan configuration.

Instead, consider using variables to access secret values received from external sources.
You can create a variable using the "External inputs" feature in the global Environment section of the scan configuration
and then utilize variable expression to inject the value into your credential.

For instance, you could create an entry in "External inputs" to define the `password1` variable,
and then set credential value to `{{password1}}`.

### Dynamic identities

In certain situations, you may need to set identities dynamically using information from one or multiple API calls.

A common example is when all operations in an API require authentication with a token returned by a "login" operation.

To achieve this, you can add a call to the "login" operation within credential, extract the token from its
response and store it in a variable named `token`. Then, use the expression `{{token}}` in the credential value to access
the dynamically retrieved token.

You can leverage operations defined in the OpenAPI to retrieve credentials or create external operations to call APIs that are not part of it.

## Tests

The Tests section enables you to define Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) and Broken Function Level Authorization (BLFA) tests,
which can be applied to your scenarios and API operations.

## Environment

### External inputs

The External Inputs section in the Environment allows you to use data from external sources in your Scan configuration.

You can provide input values from outside the Scan using:

- The Environment data stored in the IDE

- Docker container environment variables, if running the Scan with Docker or ScanD Manager outside of the IDE

Each entry in this section defines a variable name that can be used in the Scan configuration "Name" and the corresponding environment
variable to pass the value to the Scan configuration "Source environment variable".

These entries are marked as either required or not. For non-required entries, you can specify a default value that will be us
ed if an external value is not provided.

**Important**: You must provide values for all required external inputs before running the scan, otherwise it will fail.

## Settings

The Settings section allows you to customize the behavior of your Scan.

### Logging configuration

In this section, you can configure the logging level and log destination to control the verbosity and output location
 of logs generated during the scan.

### Environment settings

Choose your global environment settings for scanning.

By default, a "default" environment is created, but you can also create additional environments and switch between them.

# General Concepts

## Variable substitution

Variable substitution is a powerful feature that enables dynamic changes to your requests and responses.

### Syntax

Variable substitution uses variable expressions, which look like this: `{{variable_name}}`.

### Definition of variables

You can define variables in the following sections:

* Global environment section
* Operation environment section
* Scenario environment section
* Response processing section of the Operation or Scenario

### Usage

Variables can be used in various parts of your requests and responses, including:

* Request body
* Request parameters
* Response processing
* Identites

When performing variable substitution, the lookup order is as follows: scenario variables, operation variable, global variables.

### Variable types

Variables have types, which are defined in the Environment section. You can use variables with types `string`, `number`, `boolean`, or `null`.

### Variables in JSON

When substituting variables in the request body, always quote
 the variable expression, even if you're substituting a number or boolean.

After substitution, the actual type of the variable is used in the request.

For example, if you define a variable `age` with a numeric value of 10, and use it in a request body like this:
`{ "user_ age": "{{age}}"}` the resulting JSON will be `{ "user_age": 10 }`.

## Built-in variables

There are a number of built in variables that you can use in your scan configuration.

 - `$randomString`:  Generates a random alphanumeric string of 20 characters
 - `$randomuint`: Generates a random uint32 integer
 - `$uuid`: Generates a unique UUID
 - `$timestamp`: Generates the current time in UNIX format
 - `$timestamp3339`: Generates the current date and time as defined in RFC 3339
 - `$randomFromSchema`: Generates the values based on the schema defined in your OpenAPI definition


## Keeping configuration in sync with OpenAPI

The scan configuration must be kept in sync with the OpenAPI file it is based on,
as it is crucial for accurate and comprehensive testing. To help users keep
their scan configuration in sync, the Scan UI checks if the scan configuration
matches the OpenAPI file, and in the presence of changes, offers to update the scan configuration
accordingly.

The types of changes that the Scan UI can handle are:

- Adding new operations to the OpenAPI file
- Removing operations from the OpenAPI file
- Renaming operations (changing their `operationId`)
- Adding new security schemes to the OpenAPI file

However, changes to the schemas describing operation payloads (body, parameters, etc),
adding or removing parameters, etc. are not handled by the Scan UI, as these can be customized by the user.

If such changes are made to the OpenAPI file, the user must make appropriate changes to
the scan configuration manually.

When changes are detected, the Scan UI will prompt you to update the
scan configuration to reflect the modifications made to the OpenAPI file.
