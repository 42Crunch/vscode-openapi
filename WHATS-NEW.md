# What's New

Version 4.30 of OpenAPI editor now includes new features that let you test your APIs locally for quality, conformance and security directly in the IDE.

Our testing tools include:

- [API Audit](https://42crunch.com/api-security-audit/) - A static analysis that lets you check the quality and security of your API definition as you work on it. Static tests stop malformed data and security vulnerabilities sneaking into your code.

- [API Scan](https://42crunch.com/api-conformance-scan/) - A dynamic conformance and security tool that tests the API for conformance to the API definition and remediate any security vulnerabilities. Prevent API attacks such as BOLA, BPLA and other OWASP API Top 10 risks.

If you’re not already a 42Crunch subscriber then you can still use these API testing tools for free by [registering](command:openapi.platform.openSignUp). Learn more about the [Freemium service](https://42crunch.com/freemium/).

Freemium includes:

- Free monthly allowance of 100 operation-level audits and 100 operation-level scans.
- Allowances are calculated at the operation level. You can run full audits and full scans, but the number of operations included in the API will be counted and deducted from your monthly allowance.
- You can track your allowance and usage in the plugin settings/connection section.
- You can upgrade to a single user license if you want to increase your monthly allowances of API Audit and API Scan. [Prices](https://42crunch.com/single-user-pricing/) start from $15 a month.
- A clear path from a single user license to teams.
